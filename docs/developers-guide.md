## Frontend Development

### Intro to V2 stack

Have a look through the [Env + Tech](developers-guide-env-tech.md) page to get acquainted with some of the new technologies used in v2.
These include video's, tutorials and examples of Angular 2+, Typescript and Redux. There's also some advice on helpful plugins to use if
using Visual Studio Code. If you feel comfortable with these and are happy with your dev environment please skip straight to
[Set up Dependencies](#set-up-dependencies)

### Set up Dependencies

* Set up a Stratos backend - The frontend cannot run without a backend. Both backend and frontend exist in this same repo. To set up a backend
  run through the [deploy section](https://github.com/SUSE/stratos-ui/blob/master/deploy/README.md), choose a deployment method and bring
  one up. These deployments will bring up the entire backend, including api service and database along with a V2 frontend.
* Install [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org) (mininum version v8.6.0)
* Install [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) - `npm install -g @angular/cli`

### Configuration

Configuration information can be found in two places

* `./proxy.conf.js`
  * In fresh environments this is missing and needs to be created using `./proxy.conf.templage.js` as a template.
  * Contains the address of the backend.
  * If the backend is deployed via the instructions above this will be the same address as the V1 console's frontend address. For instance
  `https://localhost` would translate to

    ```const PROXY_CONFIG = {
      "/pp": {
        "target": {
        "host": "localhost",
        "protocol": "https:",
        "port": 443
      },
      "secure": false,
      "changeOrigin": true,
      "ws": true,
    }
    ```

* `./src/frontend/environments/environment.ts` for UAA config
  * This contains more general settings for the frontend
  * By default we output every Redux action to the console. If this is too verbose for yourself, simply set `logEnableConsoleActions` to false

## Run the frontend

1. (First time only) Copy `./proxy.conf.template.js` to `./proxy.conf.js` and update with required portal-proxy url (see above for more info)
1. Run `npm install`
1. Run `npm start` for a dev server. (the app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files)
1. Navigate to `https://localhost:4200/`. The credentials to log in will be dependent on the portal-proxy the console points at. Please refer
   to the guides used when setting up the backend for more information

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project.

The build artefacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. This will output a production build of the application.

## Creating angular items via angular cli

To create a new angular component run `ng generate component component-name`. You can use a similar command to create other types of angular
items `ng generate <directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module> <name>`.

## Theming

We use the angular material theming mechanism. See [here](https://material.angular.io/guide/theming-your-components) for more information about theming new components added to stratos.

## Test

### Lint

Run `npm run lint` to execute tslint lint checking.

### Code Climate

We use [Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/SUSE/stratos) to check for general code quality issues. This executes against Pull
Requests on creation/push.


#### Running Code Climate locally
To run locally see instructions [here](https://github.com/codeclimate/codeclimate) to install Code Climate CLI
and engine via docker. Once set ensure you're in the root of the project and execute the following (it may take a while)

```
codeclimate analyze
```

> **NOTE** Unfortunately this highlights all current issues and not those that are the diff between any master and feature branch. Analyze
can be ran against a single/sub set of files, again with all current issues, but a little more digestible.

```
codeclimate analyze <path to file/s>
```

In a feature branch to compare files that have changed to master, for instance, use the following

```
git checkout feature-branch-A
codeclimate analyze $(git diff --name-only master)
```

You can also run the above command via npm

```
npm run climate
```

### Unit tests

Run `npm test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io). Coverage information can be found in ./coverage

> **NOTE** npm test will search for chrome on your path. If this is not so please set an env var CHROME_BIN pointing to your executable
(chromium is fine too).

### End-to-end tests

Run `npm run e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

More information on the E2E tests and pre-requisites for running them is available here - [E2E Tests](developers-guide-e2e-tests.md).

## Backend Development

The backend (more informally called the portal-proxy or 'pp' for short) is still to be ported over from V1 of
[Stratos](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/stratos). Once that's completed come back and check out this section for instructions on how to
make changes to it.

WIP

### Getting started

The portal-proxy is the back-end for the Console UI. It is written in Go.

### Automatically register and connect to an existing endpoint
To automatically register a Cloud Foundry add the environment variable below

> **Note** On log in the console will also attempt to auto-connect to the cloud foundry using
           the username/password provided.

```
AUTO_REG_CF_URL=<api url of cf>
```

This env var can be set in `outputs/config.properties` if running the backend locally in the host machine, `./deploy/proxy.env` if running in docker-compose or `./manifest` if in cf push.

> **NOTE** WIP Instructions!

#### Introduction
* Golang
* Dependency Management (Glide)

#### Dependencies
* go
  * GOPATH, GOBIN env vars set
* glide
* UAA instance

#### Running portal-proxy in a container
* Follow instructions in the deploy/docker-compose docs
* To apply changes (build and update docker image) simply run `deploy/tools/restart_proxy.sh`

#### Running "like a dev"

1. Set up developer certs
    - Execute `deploy/tools/generate_cert.sh`
    - Copy `portal-proxy-output/dev-certs` to `./`
1. Update `build/dev_config.json` with `"localDevBuild": true`
1. Run `gulp local-dev-build`
1. cd ./outputs
1. Run `gulp build-backend`
1. Update `config.propeties` and ensure that..
    - the UAA points to a valid instance
    - the `CONSOLE_CLIENT` and `CONSOLE_ADMIN_SCOPE` are valid in the UAA instance
1. Run `portal-proxy`
